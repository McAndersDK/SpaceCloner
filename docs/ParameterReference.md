# Parameter Reference

This repository contains two entry scripts.

- [CloneSpace.ps1](CloneSpaceParameterReference.md) - The script to clone a set of items from space to another.
- [CloneSpaceProject.ps1](CloneSpaceProjectParameterReference.md) - Will perform a reverse lookup and determine all the items it needs to clone for you.
- [ProjectSyncer.ps1](ProjectSyncerParameterReference.md) - Will keep child project's deployment and runbook process, variables, version settings, and channel version rules in sync in the same space.  This is a subset of the clonespace.ps1.  If you want to do the same across spaces, use CloneSpace.ps1.
